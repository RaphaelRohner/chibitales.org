# chibitales.org - Milestone Project 1
Blockchain gaming! It's still a niche product, not easily accessible for Jane or Joe Doe. But it promises users not only the fun of digital gaming but the OWNERSHIP of the content created by playing the game.

One of the most promising games around is Chibi Fighters 2: A multi-platform, browser based mixture between TCG (Trading Card Game), IDLE and potentially PVP (Player vs Player) game. Unfortunately, based on blockchain technologies, it’s still struggling to find its user base.

chibitales.org aims to close that gap and provide potential new players as well as veterans with all the information necessary.

## UX
The user experience delivered by the interface: All information is a maximum of two clicks away and sorted by relevance.

New players: So far neither Chibi Fighters 2.0 nor its website provide much practical guidance to new players, not familiar with the technology.

Let's change this here:

* You want to find out what the game is about - take a look at the Homepage.

* You want to know how to set up an account - click Setup, Create Account.

* You want to know how to buy packs - click Setup, Buy Packs.

* You need an Ethereum wallet - click Trade, MetaMask.

* You want to know how to open your packs - click Setup - Open Packs and so on.

Veterans: But even for users already playing the game, changes are not transparent.

The page wants to address both groups and therefore the navigation UX is build around varying and static information:

* Relevant, ever changing information is accessible via the first two Sections: Game and Play

* More static and most likely one time information is accessible via the second two sections: Setup and Trade

* Both are following a learning curve from new to experienced

For both audiences all relevant links are accessible from anywhere:

* Open the game - click the Hero image

* Buy or support - from the Navigation Bar and from the Footer

* All social community channels from the footer

* Signing up for a fictive newsletter is integrated in the footer via a dummy Modal

## Features
* The hero image and colors used provide a visual impression of the game.

* The Navigation gives access to any section within two clicks.

* The footer provides all relevant social media links, sorted by relevance in reading direction.
 
* Potential players, which in this case are users and investors alike, find general information about the game and all necessary warnings on the main page.

* Play contains four sections giving tipps on how to play the game:

  * Adventures
  * Raids
  * Hunt
  * Match

* Setup guides users through the process of setting up an account and starting the game.

* Trade gives all necessary information on how to create an Ethereum wallet and how to use it.

* Across all pages there are directly accessible links to buy game packs and to support via kickstarter.

* Given all overview Sections are located under dropdown menues and their minor relevance the link is placed at the bottom of the dropdown.

## Future Features

* chibitales.org is meant to be work in progress and an ongoing project over the course.
* Possible features are legion:
  * A better responsive design for tablet sized devices
  * An adjusted navigation menu for more and different content
  * Explanatory tooltips for gamer's jargon via JS
  * An overview about editions and cards from the games database
  * Game statistic page / database
